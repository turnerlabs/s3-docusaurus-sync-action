# GitHub Action to build docusaurus site and Sync S3 Bucket

This is a customized version of the s3-sync-action that uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) to sync a directory (either from your repository or generated during your workflow) with a remote S3 bucket. It also runs the command: yarn run build to build the docusaurs site for deployment.

## Usage
